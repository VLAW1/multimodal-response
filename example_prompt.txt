Write a report to explain and summarize the impact of quantum computing on modern cryptography. Include diagrams showing how quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm can break RSA encryption, and a figure showing the difference in runtime between Shor's algorithm and a classical algorithm for factoring prime numbers. Compare the timeline of quantum computing development with the evolution of post-quantum cryptographic methods. End with a visual representation of which current encryption methods are most vulnerable to quantum attacks.
